C[Black to live in 1 move. I thought the bent five formed by one move could save black, but I was wrong. This situation requires a more aggressive move that puts white in atari while forming two eyes.]

C[This is not the solution in the book, but I can't find any way for white to kill this group. This is a bent five in a corner.]

C[This is a mistake for white. The critical point is now between the two white stones. Black will play there, forming two eyes and putting both of white's dead stones in atari.]

C[White sealed black's fate here by taking the key point in the bent five. Black cannot put white in atari without turning the bent five into a bent four. Black can place a stone in atari, but white will capture.]

C[Black thinks they've formed two eyes, but they've put themselves in atari. White will capture, putting all of its blacks stones in atari. White cannot recapture becaue of ko.]
