C[Tempting, but it's a mistake. Black has five seperate groups and would be lucky to form a twisted four (or dogleg four) in gote.]

C[White's move here is brutal, putting two of black's stones in atari even though it also places two of white's own stones in atari. Black can only protect the two atari by filling his false eye. Letting them get captured also destroys the false eye.]
